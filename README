OASIS

Open-source Autonomous Smart Irrigation System

======================================================================================


This is a autonomous irrigation system for indoor plants. I'm working on this project
for the people who want to have better farming experience at home.

The system has many parts as following.

1. Arduino UNO or Duemilanove
2. Micro Drippers
3. Motor Control SSR PDA1-202Z
4. DS1307 or DS3231 RTC chip
5. ULN2803 
6. Solenoid Valve DC24V 1/4" or 6mm
7. Submersible Pump 20W, 40W
8. Air Pump SH-A2
9. 1/4" or 6mm tubes
10. 1/8" or 4mm tubes
11. Various fittings
12. Water Level Sensor DM-F40
13. Aluminum Pipes of inner 10mm
14. 25 Litre Water Bucket
etc.

For now, the system doesn't have any soil moisture sensors or control panel.
In the future, it will be equipped with temperature, humidity, light intensity,
and soil moisture sensors.

The arduino control module will be expanded as a scheduler for complex process.
The process scheduler might be evolved into another system and it will be called
'XRONOS' for its timing control capability.

I'll donate this effort for anyone who wants to make something out of his/her creative
mind. Let's do it together~



Best wishes,
